Overview

Welcome to the documentation for DigiChoice, the online platform for providing teachers with physical computing help.

Purpose
-------
DigiChoice is designed to assist teachers in choosing the right physical computing hardware for their classroom.
It provides an online platform for reviews and comparison in numerous categories to help make decisions easier for
both new and experienced digital technologies teachers.

There are two key features that are integral to the design of the platform. The first is that the website is constantly
updating. A specific usability criteria has been developed to allow teachers to self-evaluate the hardware kits that
they use. These evaluations are then collated, averaged and shared to any other teachers who may be interested in
using physical computing hardware in their own classrooms. The second key feature is the ability to filter results
based on the situation that a teacher is in. This enables teachers to get the best advice for their own classrooms
without being influenced by the reviews of teachers in completely different situations.


Features
--------
The online evaluation platform has many unique features which are specifically designed to help teachers learn
about the many different hardware options on the market. These include:
    #. personalised results
    #. human readable usability reviews
    #. curriculum guides developed by other teachers

Personalised results are a key feature of the platform. It is important to recognise that hardware is not a
one size fits all solution, you should consider many factors such as the programming experience of the teacher,
the size of the class, the age of the students and what class they are being taught. This website features
automatic filtering to only show relevant data. For example, a primary school teacher with no programming
experience will have different hardware requirements to a high school teacher who has worked for 10 years in the
industry. Therefore, the filtering will ensure that teachers see the results that are relevant to them.

There are many different usability tests available for people to use. Nielson developed the heuristic framework as a
simple evaluation technique to reduce the cost of having to do large studies with test subjects. This enabled usability
analysis to take place iteratively as part of the design process. This has been extended by Michael Kolling to be
specific to novice usability environments. The issue is that the heuristic evaluation method requires trained usability
experts to conduct the analysis. This means that the analysis should be completed during the design stage of
development. It is evident by the lack of usability literature on physical computing hardware that this usability
testing during the design stage is insuffcient. This website uses a modified version of the heuristics proposed by
Kolling.
