Design
======
The design chapter provides an overview of each design aspect for the website. This is broken down into the
pages that appear on the site and the design of the usability survey that is hosted on the site.

Pages
-----
This website consists of 8 different pages. This provides a breakdown of the design and purpose of each page.

Index
~~~~~

This is the landing page for the website. This page provides teachers with the ability to look through all of the
different programmable hardware kits on the market. This list is editable by teachers through the hardware model.
It therefore should be maintained by the community of teachers who use the website. Attached to each hardware kit
is a ranking system. This ranking system consists of a number of categories which are all rated out of 5.

The user is able to filter through the information of the teachers who have submitted the usability surveys for the
hardware kits. This gives them the ability to only look at teachesr who are in a similar situation to them.
For example:

        A teacher who teaches grade 1 and 2 with no programming experience is going to have different requirements
        than a year 11 and 12 teacher with industrial programming experience.

Therefore the filter can help ensure that the right hardware is being used by the right teachers in the correct
situation.

About
~~~~~

This page provides a public facing summary of this information. It gives the users of the website a brief overview
of the benefits that the website provides them and the features that it has. It also includes a summary of the
usability survey with an extended summary of the definitions. This will ensure that if there is any confusion about
the definition of terms in the survey, there will be a place where teachers are able to find information.


Device Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The index page provides a summary of the information about each piece of hardware, the profile page provides a more
in-depth look at the hardware. This is created through a combination of facts about the hardware, the usability ratings
provided by users and extended response questions completed along with the surveys.

The extended response questions will allow teachers to get an understanding of the benefits and challenges that
other teachers have encountered when using this particular piece of hardware in their classrooms. As with the index
page, this can be filtered to ensure that the information is relevant to the teacher looking at the website.

TODO: Summaries of the question answers could be provided in graph form, rather than numerically.


Profile
~~~~~~~

User profiles are not visible to anyone except the currently logged in user. They are designed to allow a logged in
user to be able to view and edit all of the information that they have submitted to the site. Therefore, they are
able to view all of their responses to the registration survey which includes questions on:

    - State
    - Year levels
    - Class size
    - Subjects
    - Hardware
    - Technology background
    - Programming background

It is important that teachers are able to edit this information because it can change over time. Additionally teachers
are only able to complete surveys for hardware that they have responded that they use. This is to help ensure that
the reviews are helpful to other teachers. This however is reliant on respondents being truthful about the products
that they use.

Register
~~~~~~~~

People are able to register to access the full functionality of the website. As the information for the survey is
collected from both the online form and the user account of the respondent, a person must have an account in order to
submit a survey. The registration process collects all of the information that is displayed on the users profile
and is used to filter the hardware recommendations for other teachers.

Submit Survey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This page allows teachers to submit a survey for a specified physical computing hardware kit. The survey that they
are able to submit is detailed in the usability survey section.

Usability
---------

This website hosts a usability survey that is used to help teachers choose between programmable hardware
devices that are available on the market. As the survey is targeted towards teachers it needs to be understandable at
a much lower level than other usability surveys. This low entry level is required to make it accessible to teachers
who do not have a background in computer science. This is the group of teachers who will gain the most benefit from
this system.

Theory

Usability

Domain specific usability

This usability scale is built on a number of different usability scales that have previously been developed.

Surveys
~~~~~~~

There are two seperate surveys that are hosted on the site. The first, registration survey, provides background
information about the users that can be used to filter hardware options for teachers in different situations. The
second survey is a usability survey which is designed to provide at-a-glance information. This willenable teachers
to make quick and accurate decisions about the best physical computing hardware to implement in their classroom.

Registration Survey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This survey has already been discussed in the profile section of this document. This section details the actual
wording of the questions as they appear on the site.

    #. Which state do you primarily teach in?
    #. What year level(s) have you taught in the last 5 years?
    #. What subjects have you taught in the last 5 years?
    #. What is your typical class size?
    #. What is your background with technology?
    #. What is your previous computer programming experience?

Usability Survey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The questions that are used in the online survey.

**Non-threatening**
    #. How inviting do you believe the interface is to new users?
    #. Are you afraid that you may lose all your work due to small mistakes?
    #. How do students feel the first time that they use this system?

**Engagement**
    #. Are the students motivated by this system?
    #. Are they excited by the possibility of class time spent with this hardware?

**Visibility**
    #. How often does the system do something that you werenâ€™t expecting?
    #. How often does the system do something without your knowledge?

**Clarity**
    #. How clear is the interface?
    #. How often do you need to look up what things mean when interacting with the system?
    #. How long do you have to spend explaining the interface to new students?

**Error Avoidance**
    #. How often do error messages appear?
    #. How often do the programs break?

**Feedback**
    #. Do things happen in the program that are difficult to debug?
