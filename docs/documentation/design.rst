Design
===============
Welcome to the documentation for this FYP Website.

Pages
----------------
Subtitles are set with '-' and are required to have the same length
of the subtitle itself, just like titles.

Lists can be unnumbered like:

 * Item Foo
 * Item Bar

Or automatically numbered:

 #. Item 1
 #. Item 2

Surveys
-------------
Words can have *emphasis in italics* or be **bold** and you can define
code samples with back quotes, like when you talk about a command: ``sudo``
gives you super user powers!

Usability
-------------

This is a section about the usability aspects of the design.
